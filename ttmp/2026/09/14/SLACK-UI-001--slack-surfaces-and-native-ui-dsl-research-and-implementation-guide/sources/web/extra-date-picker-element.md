## Fields

| Field | Type | Description | Required? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | String | The type of element. In this case `type` is always `datepicker`. | Required |
| `action_id` | String | An identifier for the action triggered when a menu option is selected. You can use this when you receive an interaction payload to [identify the source of the action](https://docs.slack.dev/interactivity/handling-user-interaction#payloads). Should be unique among all other `action_id` s in the containing block. Maximum length is 255 characters. | Optional |
| `initial_date` | String | The initial date that is selected when the element is loaded. This should be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. | Optional |
| `confirm` | Object | A [confirm object](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/confirmation-dialog-object) that defines an optional confirmation dialog that appears after a date is selected. | Optional |
| `focus_on_load` | Boolean | Indicates whether the element will be set to auto focus within the [`view object`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/views). Only one element can be set to `true`. Defaults to `false`. | Optional |
| `placeholder` | Object | A [`plain_text`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/text-object) only text object that defines the placeholder text shown on the datepicker. Maximum length for the `text` in this field is 150 characters. | Optional |

## Example

The date picker element must be used inside the [section](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/block-kit/blocks/section-block) block, [actions](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/block-kit/blocks/actions-block) block, or [input](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/block-kit/blocks/input-block) block. This example shows a section block containing a date picker element:
